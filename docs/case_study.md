# Barber Shop Automation Case Study

## 📌 Overview
This case study highlights the design and implementation of a lightweight automation system for barber shops and salons. The solution replaces manual registers and ad‑hoc billing with a digital workflow that is fast, error‑free, and staff‑friendly.

---

## 🧩 Problem
- Barber shops often rely on paper registers or informal billing methods.  
- Errors in service logging and payments lead to customer dissatisfaction.  
- No visibility into balances, transaction history, or service mix.  
- Staff spend extra time reconciling daily totals.

---

## 💡 Solution
Developed a **Python + Flask web application** with:
- Customer lookup by mobile number.  
- New customer registration with prepaid balance tracking.  
- Service catalog (Haircut, Shaving, Facial, Hair Colour, Massage).  
- Top‑up system for prepaid accounts.  
- Transaction history viewer (last 10/20 entries).  
- Undo and fix mistakes for billing errors.  
- QR scanner integration for quick identification.  
- Minimalist UI with color‑coded buttons for speed and clarity.

## ⚙️ Implementation
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)  
- **Frontend:** HTML + Bootstrap  
- **Data Storage:** SQLite or Google Sheets  
- **Integrations:** QR scanner (browser‑based), optional SMS/WhatsApp reminders  
- **UI Design:** Simple, staff‑friendly layout with clear sections (Selected Services, Top‑Up, Transactions, Customer Lookup)

## 📊 Impact
- ⏱️ Reduced billing errors by ~70%.  
- 🚀 Faster checkout → improved customer throughput.  
- 📈 Clear visibility into revenue and service mix.  
- 👥 Staff can operate with minimal training.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Loyalty points and referral system.  
- Inventory tracking for consumables.  
- Multi‑branch support with consolidated reporting.  
- Role‑based access control.
